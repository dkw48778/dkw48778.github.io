<h1> Selecting Your Flooring: Basics </h1>
<p> 

<img src="carpet.jpg" alt="carpet" style="width:600px;height:600px;margin-left:15px;"> 
There are several things to consider when you think about making decisions about your flooring. You should think about your budget but you will also need to think about some other things. You should think about your individual preferences such as do you want a warm or cool surface (carpet or hard surface). How much foot traffic will your area endure? Do you have pets or children which might lead to stains or spills? What is the likelyhood that there will be water that will come in contact with your flooring? What type of subfloor material will you be covering (concrete, plywood, particle board...). Other considerations will be mentioned further on in this page. </p>

<h2> <a name="Costs"> Other Costs </a> </h2>

	<p> Remember to include the fact that there will be certain additional costs and there may be some unforseen costs </p>
			<ul> 
			<li> Installation, preparation: Consider whether furniture will need to be moved. Take-up and disposal of old materials. </li>
			<li> Installation, floor prep: With carpet there will be padding and tack strip. If a new ceramic or porcelin area, there will be water-proof backerboard. If the sub-floor is particle board, it will have to be replaced. </li>
			<li> Actual Installation: Installation is charged at a per sq.ft. price. There will be materials to attach the product such as adhesives, grout, mortar, nails, etc. (these items are not high ticket items). </li>
			</ul>
